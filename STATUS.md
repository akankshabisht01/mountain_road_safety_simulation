## 💡 WHAT TO EMPHASIZE IN DEMO

### **Strongest Points:**
1. **Real Data** - "This is actual Bhikyasen Road from Google Earth"
2. **Physics-Based** - "Not guesswork - thermodynamics and mechanics"
3. **Segment #64** - "50% slope! Immediately identifies the danger"
4. **Brake Temperature** - "Innovative prediction of brake failure"
5. **Actionable** - "Not just analysis - specific recommendations with costs"
6. **Immediate Impact** - "100+ lives saved annually potential"

### **Most Impressive Visuals:**
1. Elevation profile with risk overlay (Tab 1)
2. Brake temperature chart showing heat buildup (Tab 3)
3. 2D road map with color coding (Tab 2)
4. Scenario comparison showing 4x risk increase (Comparison mode)
5. Recommendations with cost estimates (Tab 5)

## 📞 SUPPORT INFORMATION

### If Issues Arise:

**Dashboard won't start:**
```powershell
streamlit run app.py --server.port 8502
```

**Import errors:**
```powershell
pip install --upgrade streamlit pandas numpy plotly matplotlib seaborn
```
